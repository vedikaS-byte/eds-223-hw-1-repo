# Visualizing the Impact of Hazardous Waste Facility Proximity in Texas Counties Based on Communities of Color

## Description

The state of Texas, consisting of 254 counties, is culturally and racially diverse. A topic of interest regarding environmental justice includes waste management impacts on communities, especially communities of color. Travis County, which includes the City of Austin, has been shaped by a legacy of systemic racism and exclusion that continues to affect communities of color today ([City of Austin, n.d](https://www.austintexas.gov/department/history-equity-office)). This analysis aims to explore the proximity of hazardous waste facilities to communities based on demographic makeup. Additionally, the Hazardous Waste Proximity Environmental Justice (EJ) Index is used to assess the extent of hazardous waste impact from facilities in block groups within Travis County.

## Data Access

The Environmental Justice Mapping and Screening Tool was created by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to track and reveal environmental injustices based on several socioeconomic variables. The dataset was downloaded from the [EPA website](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/download-ejscreen-data) and contains environmental and demographic data at the block group level. This dataset was provided for an assignment for EDS 223 as a class for the MEDS program at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, UC Santa Barbara.

## Contributions

This repository was created by Vedika Shirtekar for the EDS 223 course as part of the Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program. Compiled data and instructions neccessary for the assignment were provided by The Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, UC Santa Barbara.
